It’s mainly coded in C++ and C with a great challenge : 30 FPS !
I added more challenges :

* MOD/S3M musics
* 16 bit colors
* Realtime lighting
* Water simulation with terrain interaction
* Terrain generation (noise and other fun things)
* EXTREME gameplay fun with a « almost perfect » player controller

All challenges are achieved and we can now show the result.

Main character sprites are from « rvros » ( https://rvros.itch.io/ )

Tiles are from itch.io (i will post credits when i find them)
